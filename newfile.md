When you are building a new website, it is important to have a good starting foundation. In this article, I will explain what an HTML 5 boilerplate is and how to create a basic template to use in your projects.

## Basic syntax

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge">
    <title>HTML 5 Boilerplate</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
  </head>
  <body>
	<script src="index.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

> Tip: The simplest way to do this is through typing ! and tab keys

The first line in your HTML code should be the doctype declaration. A doctype tells the browser what version of HTML the page is written in.

## What is the HTML root element?
The <html> tag is the top level element of the HTML file. You will nest the <head> and <body> tags inside of it.
